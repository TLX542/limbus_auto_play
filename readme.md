---

## üéÆ Setup & Usage

### Initial Setup

1. **Launch Limbus Company** on any monitor
2. **Have the game in full screen** so the line checked is lined up for the program 
3. **Make sure** the Win Rate button is visible and not covered by other windows

### Running the Script

1. **Double-click** `LAP.py` 
2. **Choose your monitor** (if you have multiple screens)
3. **Verify resolution** settings when prompted (most usually take the recommended setting)
4. **Let it run** - the script will automatically detect and click the Win Rate button

### Stopping the Script

- **Press 'P'** on your keyboard to stop anytime
- Or use **Ctrl+C** in the console window

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Multi-Monitor Support

### Automatic Detection
The script automatically finds all your monitors and shows them like this:
```
====== Monitor Selection ======
1. Monitor 1: 1920x1080 (Primary)
2. Monitor 2: 2560x1440
3. Monitor 3: 3840x2160

Select monitor (1-3): 
```

### Windows Display Scaling
If you're using Windows display scaling (common on high-resolution monitors), the script will:
- **Detect** common scaling levels (125%, 150%, 175%, 200%)
- **Warn you** if scaling might cause issues
- **Recommend** the correct resolution to use

**Example:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  This looks like 1536x864 (125% scaling)
   Your actual monitor resolution is probably: 1920x1080
```

### Resolution Options
For non-primary monitors, you can choose:
- **Use detected resolution** (might be wrong due to scaling)
- **Use recommended resolution** (usually correct)
- **Pick from common resolutions** (1920√ó1080, 2560√ó1440, 4K)
- **Enter custom resolution** (type it manually)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings & Customization

All settings are in the `settings.ini` file. You can edit it with any text editor (like Notepad).

### Common Settings to Change

**Stop Alt+Tab after clicking:**
```ini
ALT_TAB_AFTER_CLICK = true    # Switches away from game after clicking
```

**Keep cursor in place:**
```ini
RESET_CURSOR_POSITION = false    # Cursor stays at button location
```

**Enable debug logging:**
```ini
DEBUG_LOGGING = true    # Creates detailed log.txt file for troubleshooting
```

**Adjust detection timing:**
```ini
CHECK_INTERVAL = 2    # Wait 2 seconds between scans (default is 1)
```

### Color Detection Settings
*Only change these if the button isn't being detected:*

```ini
[DETECTION]
TARGET_COLOR_R = 59        # Main button color (red part)
TARGET_COLOR_G = 1         # Main button color (green part)
TARGET_COLOR_B = 0         # Main button color (blue part)
TOLERANCE = 15             # How close colors need to match (higher = more lenient)
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Button Not Being Detected

**First, try this:**
1. Enable debug logging: Set `DEBUG_LOGGING = true` in `settings.ini`
2. Run the script again
3. Check the `log.txt` file for details

**Common fixes:**
- Make sure the Win Rate button is **fully visible** on screen
- Try increasing the **TOLERANCE** value in settings (try 15 or 20) (a tolerance too high might make it click something else)
- Ensure game window is positioned in the **bottom-right** of your monitor
- Check if you selected the **correct monitor**

### Multi-Monitor Issues

**Monitor not detected:**
- Install screeninfo: Open Command Prompt and type `pip install screeninfo`
- Restart the script

**Clicks in wrong location:**
- **Most common cause:** Windows display scaling
- **Solution:** Choose "Use recommended resolution" when prompted
- **Alternative:** Use custom resolution with your monitor's actual size

**Cursor gets stuck:**
- Enable `FORCE_CURSOR_TO_MONITOR = true` in settings
- Try running game in windowed mode instead of fullscreen

### Installation Problems

**Python not found:**
- Run `installer.bat` as Administrator
- If it still fails, download Python from python.org

**Permission errors:**
- Right-click `installer.bat` and select "Run as administrator"
- Check if antivirus is blocking the script

**Script won't start:**
- Make sure ALL files are in the same folder
- Ensure `settings.ini` file exists

### Display Scaling Issues

**Symptoms:** Clicks appear in wrong location, offset from button
**Cause:** Windows is using display scaling (125%, 150%, etc.)
**Solution:** 
1. When setting up, choose "Use likely actual resolution" 
2. Or use custom resolution with your monitor's real size
3. Enable debug logging to see coordinate calculations

## üîç Advanced Features

### Debug Logging System

**What it does:** Creates detailed `log.txt` file showing exactly what the script is doing

**When to use:**
- Button detection isn't working
- Clicks are in wrong location
- Multi-monitor setup issues

**How to enable:**
1. Open `settings.ini`
2. Change `DEBUG_LOGGING = false` to `DEBUG_LOGGING = true`
3. Save and restart script
4. Check `log.txt` file for detailed information

### Project File Structure
```
limbus_auto_player/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LAP.py          # Main file - double-click this to start
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ settings.ini        # Edit this to change settings
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ installer.bat       # Run this first to install everything
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # This help file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/                # Supporting files (don't modify these)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.py
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ monitor.py
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mouse.py
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ screenshot.py
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ detection.py
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logger.py
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils.py
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scaling_utils.py
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ library_checker.py
```

### How Detection Works
The script looks for specific colors on your screen:
- **Main color:** Dark red `#3B0100` (the button background)
- **Accent color:** Orange/gold `#F6AF64` (button highlights)
- **Search area:** Scans horizontally at 74.17% from the top of screen
- **Direction:** Searches right to left for faster detection

### Custom Resolution Format
When entering custom resolution, use format: `WIDTHxHEIGHT`
- **Examples:** `1920x1080`, `2560x1440`, `3840x2160`
- **Don't use spaces or other characters**

## üìù Important Notes

### Safety & Terms of Service
- **Personal use only** - don't distribute or commercialize
- **Monitor the script** - don't leave it running unattended for hours
- **Game updates** may require script updates if UI changes
- **Be aware of the risks** before using automation tools

### Performance Tips
- **Single monitor setup** is more reliable than multi-monitor

### Technical Limitations
- **Windows only** - doesn't work on Mac or Linux
- **GUI-based detection** - if button appearance changes, script needs updates
- **No game modification** - only automates mouse clicks and keyboard input
- **No unfair advantage** - just automates repetitive clicking
